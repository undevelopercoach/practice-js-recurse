# Practice JavaScript Recursion

A set of three exercises in JavaScript to practice writing recursive solutions.
Exercises are numbered from 0 to 2 and get progressively harder.
Each exercise is structured as a unit test suite with one or more tests, which must all pass in order to complete the exercise.
You must use recursion to solve the problems. Further instructions can be found in each exercise.

## Instructions

1. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies (just `jest` and an optional library for creating PNG files)
2. Run `npm run test` or `npm start` to run the unit tests. They will all fail to start with.
3. Make 'em pass!

## The exercises

0. [Multiply two integers without using the multiplication operator](https://github.com/undevelopercoach/practice-js-recursion/blob/main/exercises/0-multiplyIntegers.test.js)
1. [Detect whether a string is a palindrome](https://github.com/undevelopercoach/practice-js-recursion/blob/main/exercises/1-isPalindrome.test.js)
2. [Implement a binary search for a value in a sorted array](https://github.com/undevelopercoach/practice-js-recursion/blob/main/exercises/2-binarySearch.test.js)

## Disclaimer

This project is intended purely as a means to practice writing recursion for various contrived examples. The use of recursion may not actually be the best way to solve these problems "in real life"; nor are these exercises intended in any way to demonstrate "best practice" â€“ they are just for fun!
